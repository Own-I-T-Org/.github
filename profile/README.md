# Own IT Org

We have the goal to help small and medium sized companies (e.g., start-ups) to use the transformations they go through as a means for growing the business and team spirit.

Our contribution is in the Digitalisation space. As consultants, we help you identify and visualize the processes that keep your company running today. Then we develop plans, how software and AI can help you optimize these processes, especially when new constraints enter your business space.
As software engineers and UX designers, we find, integrate and contribute to open source projects in the workflow-BPMN space.

## Current stack (WIP)

In most cases we want to use the open source projects around the [Camunda](https://github.com/camunda) space, and contribute to them as well.
If a customer is too big for our internal means to help them, we want to connect them to our soon-to-be partner [SAP Signavio](https://github.com/signavio).
If a customer is very passionate about running their own workflow system on their self-hosted kubernetes installations, we want to connect them to our soon-to-be partners around [Kogito](http://kogito.kie.org/), which are [Red Hat](https://redhat.com) and the [KIE Group](https://github.com/kiegroup).
