# Own IT Org

We have the goal to help small and medium sized companies (e.g., start-ups) to use the transformations they go through as a means for growing the business and team spirit.

Our contribution is in the Digitalisation space. As consultants, we help you identify and visualize the processes that keep your company running today. Then we develop plans, how software and AI can help you optimize these processes, especially when new constraints enter your business space.
As software engineers and UX designers, we find, integrate and contribute to open source projects in the workflow-BPMN space.

## Current stack (v0.2 - WIP)

In most cases we want to use the open source projects around the [Camunda](https://github.com/camunda) space.
If a customer is too big for our internal means to help them, we want to connect them to our soon-to-be partner [SAP Signavio](https://github.com/signavio).
If a customer is very passionate about running their own workflow system on their self-hosted kubernetes installations, we want to connect them to our soon-to-be partners around [Kogito](http://kogito.kie.org/), which are [Red Hat](https://redhat.com) and the [KIE Group](https://github.com/kiegroup).

As Platform for Open Source contributions we use Git + [Github](https://github.com/). Our software runs in containers managed by [Podman](https://github.com/containers/podman).
Documentation, ramblings and internal Wiki is [Obsidian](https://github.com/obsidianmd).

As can be seen from the choices, Open Source is preferred. We believe that [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) software allows us to use the best technology available in areas
which are not competitive for us, and allows us to contribute and influence the direction of these projects in ways that closed software could not.
For instance, we believe to really rely on a software, it needs to have more
than one company sponsoring its development. This will ensure democratic
processes are established and maintained, and it allows us to follow and
participate in the features and bugfixes that are relevant to us.

To reap these benefits a major step will be to encourage all these projects to
adapt a multi-sponsor system with democratically voted leadership and
processes, where they might not have that yet.
